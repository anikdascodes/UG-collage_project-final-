A comprehensive comparative study analyzing the effectiveness of traditional time series models versus modern deep learning approaches for stock price prediction using Yahoo stock data (2015-2020).

## üìä Project Overview

This project examines the performance of classical statistical methods (AR, ARIMA, SARIMAX) against deep learning techniques (LSTM) for financial time series forecasting. Our analysis spans a critical 5-year period capturing major economic events including the COVID-19 pandemic, providing insights into model resilience during market volatility.

### üéØ Key Objectives

- Compare effectiveness of classical vs. modern forecasting approaches
- Analyze model performance during high volatility periods (COVID-19 crash)
- Implement comprehensive time series analysis and feature engineering
- Evaluate predictive accuracy using multiple statistical metrics

## üèÜ Key Results

| Model | RMSE | R¬≤ Score | Performance Highlights |
|-------|------|----------|----------------------|
| **LSTM (Test)** | **105.81** | **0.85** | **Superior complex pattern recognition** |
| AR(2) | 26.98 | 0.95 | Best among classical models |
| ARIMA(1,1,1) | 55.78 | -3.89 | Basic trend modeling |
| ARIMA(2,0,1) | 29.97 | - | Good linear relationships |
| SARIMAX(1,1,1)(1,1,1,12) | 65.14 | - | Best overall SARIMAX |
| SARIMAX(2,1,2)(1,0,0,12) | 56.86 | - | Lowest SARIMAX RMSE |

### üîç Main Findings

- **LSTM achieved 85.16% R-squared accuracy** on test data, significantly outperforming classical models
- Deep learning models showed superior resilience during the COVID-19 market crash
- Classical models provided good baselines but struggled with non-linear, volatile patterns
- LSTM effectively captured long-term dependencies and complex market dynamics
